# A Complex Game

**A Complex Game** is a web-based game where you press a button to increment a hierarchical number displayed in parentheses. The number increases by a specified amount each time you press the button. This is also a Googology game, as LNGI' are very popular, and I thought why not? 

## Features

- **Increment**: Press buttons to add a specified value to the current number.
- **Simple UI**: A user-friendly interface with buttons for different increments.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Press one of the buttons labeled `+1`, `+5`, or `+10`.
3. The number in parentheses will increase by the value associated with the button you pressed.
